        <h2>What is BMI?</h2>
        <p>
            BMI (Body Mass Index) is a measurement that assesses your body weight relative to your height. It is a simple tool to help you understand whether you're underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.

        <h2>How to Calculate BMI</h2>
        <p>
            BMI can be calculated using the following formula:
        </p>
        <p>
            BMI = (Weight in kilograms) / (Height in meters)^2
        </p>
        <p>For example, if you weigh 70 kg and your height is 1.75 meters:</p>
        <p>BMI = 70 / (1.75^2) = 22.86</p>
